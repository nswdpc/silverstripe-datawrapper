## How to create a element

> Audience: content editors, authors and creators

To create an element, the chart or map first needs to be created in Datawrapper

1. Sign in to your [Datawrapper account](https://app.datawrapper.de)
2. Create or find your chart / map
3. Edit the chart or map as required (refer to the Datawrapper Academy documentation for assistance)
4. Once published you fill need to copy a Datawrapper ID and Version to the CMS element

## Datawrapper content id & version

In the "Share & Embed" section on your chart/map:

* Check "fullscreen" next to Share via URL"
* You will see a URL like "https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/abcd1/10/"
* The Datawrapper ID value is "abcd1"
* The Datawrapper Version is "10"

You do not need to copy the embed code or script, this is created for you in the CMS.

In the "Datawrapper" CMS element you have created, add the  following values:

* Datawrapper Id: abcd1
* Datawrapper Version: 10

You can also select the following optional fields:
- Title
- lazy load option (this will load the iframe after other page content is loaded)
- enforce full width
- initial iframe height

Please also complete the "Alternate content for used for assistive technologies" field as this is a WCAG requirement for accessibility.

Then save the element or, optionally, publish.

## Republish

When a datawrapper element is re-published due to changes, the version will increment.

To update the version on your website, simply set the "Datawrapper version" field to the version you require.

Then save the element to review changes or, optionally, publish.
